"Wandelust is a web application I developed as a clone of Airbnb, using EJS for templating, Node.js for the backend, and Express as the web framework. The project aims to replicate the core features of Airbnb, including property listings, user authentication, and a booking system."
"Some of the key features of Wandelust include user authentication with secure login and registration, a dynamic property listing system where users can filter properties based on location and reviews.

Wanderlust is an online marketplace that connects people looking to rent their homes with 
travelers seeking accommodations. Hosts can list their properties, which can be anything 
from a spare room to an entire house, and guests can book these accommodations for 
short-term stays. Wanderlust provides a platform for communication between hosts and 
guests, offering a wide range of options in various locationsÂ worldwide.
